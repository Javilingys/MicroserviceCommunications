# Microservice Communications

*This is **TRASH** project only for **ME**. Because i wanna train/study in microservice communications such as 
**synchronous messaging**, **asynchronous messaging**, **different brokers/ways to include all stuff**, **Outbox/sagas pattern**, **ApiGateway/BFF** ,**EFCore/Dapper/SQL/NoSQL**, **sharding postgreSQL** and so on..*

*Also this project DOESN'T containe any meaningful logic. It's just a set of **random** microservices with **random** logic. Only communication and other stuff matters*

*This project may and probably should contain bugs and bad code. But it's only for myself train purposes.*
